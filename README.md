# FIDL Language Support for Visual Studio Code

This extension adds:
 - syntax highlighting to [FIDL][fidl] files.
 - a command to jump from generated bindings to FIDL source.


The syntax highlighting is generated by a script called `generate-syntax.ts`. That can be run by:
```
npm install
npm run-script build-syntax
```
